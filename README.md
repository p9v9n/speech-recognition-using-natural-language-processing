# speech-recognition-using-natural-language-processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps computers learn, understand, and produce content in human or natural language. Text/character recognition and speech/voice recognition are capable of inputting the information in the system, and NLP helps these applications make sense of this information

we will take a closer look at how speech recognition really works. Now, when we say speech recognition, weâ€™re really talking about ASR, or automatic speech recognition. With automatic speech recognition, the goal is to simply input any continuous audio speech and output the text equivalent. We want our ASR to be speaker-independent and have high accuracy. Such a system has long been a core goal of AI, and in the 1980s and 1990s, advances in probabilistic models began to make automatic speech recognition a reality.
